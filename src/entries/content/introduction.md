title: About Me
---

I'm a student conducting research regarding Autonomous Driving. I was a software engineer with 5 years of experience specializing game engine development and mixed reality simulations. My primary focus was on enhancing the performance of game engines, creating convenient tools and APIs for developers. In my previous roles in the industry, I directly engaged in game development as a Game Engine Developer.
I like to learn new theories and apply them into practice to make our life better.
