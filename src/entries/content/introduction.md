title: About Me
---

I'm a master's student conducting research on AIGC for Autonomous Driving at the University of Macau. I was a software engineer with 5 years of experience, which included a 4-year on-campus study and 1 year of full-time work experience in the field of software, specializing game engine development as well as mixed reality simulations. My primary focus was on enhancing the performance of rendering engines, creating convenient tools and APIs for game developers. In my previous roles in the industry, I directly engaged in game development as a Game Engine Developer, while my focus during school was primarily on multimedia and simulation.
I like to learn new theories and apply them into practice to make our life better.
